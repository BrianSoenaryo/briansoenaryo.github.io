								<p>Parents and early childhood educators in the English-speaking countries particularly, often have a misconception view
								about teaching the children a diverse language. People often assume that multi-language learning during infant-toddler
								stage can confuse children which slower their language abilities. However, the delay of children’s speaking abilities is
								a complex system, and this could be due to the words processing capacity of the toddlers where they still develop to be
								able to untangle the sets of grammar and vocabulary (Nemeth, 2012). The advantages of learning different languages
								have been suggested by many researchers as there are numerous benefits of foreign language acquisition from the
								early age stage. The main benefits of multi-language acquisition and exposure to children at an early age help the
								promotion of healthy children’s cognitive development (Bialystok, 2006; Nemeth, 2012).</p>

								<h3>The benefits of different language acquisition in early childhood</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>Improve children’s cognitive development</strong><br>
										A bilingual child is proved to outperform the monolingual child in terms of their intelligence performance due
										to various aspects such as better concept formation and mental flexibility in the child who speaks more than
										one language which can affect children’s academic progress (Peal &amp; Lambert, 1962).
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Encourage children to learn a different culture</strong><br>
										Another benefit of second language acquisition is the opportunity for the children to learn a different culture
										through a language learning program. Learning different languages helps children to understand diverse
										culture which helps them to have a broader perspective and become more open-minded people.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>To support the inclusive environment in early childhood settings.</strong><br>
										The provision of foreign language learning in early childhood settings helps to promote the inclusive
										environment for the children with non-English speaking background as every child has an equal opportunity
										to learn. The community from different or minority backgrounds also can more being feel welcomed and
										respected in educational settings.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Learning a new language at an early age is easier and faster.</strong><br>
										Many researchers suggest that learning foreign language is better to start from the early age is as the learning
										capability of the children is faster due to the brain development that still on the continuous development in
										this early age, where children’s brain proved to be more flexible compared to the adults (Thompson et al.,
										2000).

								<p>Music is an important aspect of human life as it has various impacts across arts, culture, communication, and
								entertainment. Music also has a great potential for facilitating children’s literacy learning, as music is connected to
								children’s lives mentally and emotionally which encourages children to engages in a thinking process (Salmon, 2010).
								Many researchers highlighted the benefits of utilise a music as a tool to introduce a language to the children as music
								can provide an opportunity for children to explore the language and culture of foreign country through the rhythms
								and rhymes of the song which has a strong component of language that helps children to acquire a component of the
								new language (Nemeth, 2012). The utilisation of music as the tools for language learning often neglected in the early
								childhood curriculum program although in fact the song can provide a great opportunity for children to learn a
								complex sentence structure, range of vocabulary, and grammatical of the language itself (Murray, 2005).</p>

								</span>
								<p>Language
								and music also share many features in terms of their cognitive domains and sensory-perceptual as they use the same
								acoustic cues to convey the meaning of the sound (Moreno, Lee, Janus &amp; Bialystok, 2014). Even though language
								processing skills lie on the left hemisphere of the brain and music processing is lies on the right brain, the
								combination
								of the music with the rich language content could promote the connections between both hemispheres which support
								children’s critical thinking and enhance a problem-solving skill of the children (Salmon, 2010). Music also has great
								potential to trigger a child’s understanding and creative writing through the activation of child’s schemas which allow
								children to explore and express developing ideas and thoughts through their play and exploration (Louis &amp;
								Featherstone, 2008; Salmon, 2010).</p>

									<li>
										<strong>Music helps to learn a different culture</strong><br>
										Culture is an important part of every language around the world. Music can serve as a tool to establish a cultural
										connection to the children as the learning of music from different languages and ethnic in order to encourage children
										to have cultural awareness. In addition, Music provides a playful experience for the children to learn new language
										which melody and words inside the song can help children to understand and memorize a new word of a new language
										(Fonseca Mora &amp; Gant, 2016). The music and songs are varying around the world, and it has a distinctive cultural
										component and tones in every song that makes music a great vehicle for the children to learn different music
										characters which unique according the cultural background.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>A music can enhance language recall</strong><br>
										According to the research conducted by Good, Russo &amp; Sullivan (2014), rhythm and a melodic component of the song
										could enhance children’s recall ability of the foreign text and vocabulary. The educators are commonly using a song in
										some group time learning to support encoding and retrieval information such as the song “head shoulder knees and
										toes”. Similar practice with the foreign language, which through the song children will be easier to evoke and
										comprehend the sentence structure and vocabulary of the language. Another explanation why it is easier to acquire a
										new language through music is because of the individual abilities in utilise structural characteristics of spoken text
										are better when rhythmic characteristics were emphasised (Wallace &amp; Rubin, 1991). The factors contributing to the song
										advantage on enhancing children’s abilities to recall memory is due to the cognitive and hedonic factors. Hedonic
										factors is the enjoyment to the children that could bring by the singing and results in the increase of children’s
										attention and concentration as they feel interested with such activity (Good et al., 2014).
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Foreign language pronunciation learning with music</strong><br>
										Pronunciation of the language is one of the most prominent components. The song could be an effective way to
										practice a foreign language articulation as song has an obvious pronunciation that shows the example of how certain
										words should be pronounced (Good et al., 2014). Therefore, a language sentence combined with addition of music
										which becomes a song could make children easier in memorizing and recall the correct pronunciation of the foreign
										language (Brandt, Gebrian &amp; Slevc, 2012).
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Music provides an opportunity for children with disabilities</strong><br>
										Educators often use music as an element to meet a group and individuals needs of the young children, and it also could
										use as a specialised musical instruction that particularly assists learning of children with disabilities including
										children with a hearing limitation (Nelson, Wright &amp; Parker, 2015). Nelson, Wright &amp; Parker (2015) also denotes that the
										utilisation of music in auditory training combined with the hearing aid technology such as hearing aids, bone-anchored
										implants, and cochlear implants enables children with hearing impairment to access sound and certain frequency
										which helps them to comprehend the language through the richness and complexity of musical signal.

								<h2 class="major" style="width: 100%;">The role of the early childhood professional</h2>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="Figure 4" />
									<span style="font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 6.</span> illustrates the warm relationship between children and educators, adapted from teach.nsw, retrieved from <a style="display: inline-block;" target="_blank"

								</span>
								<p>Early childhood educators have a crucial role in supporting, promoting and engaging families from different
								backgrounds. The increase of multicultural due to the globalisation is inevitable, and there is an innumerable benefit
								for the children in learning a foreign language at an early age. Because of the changing world, every early childhood
								professional should be able to anticipate the increase in the multicultural background in early childhood settings.
								Furthermore, educators and should also be aware of the substantial advantages of foreign language acquisition from an
								early age. The educator’s perception towards a diverse language learning is could impact the effectiveness of the
								diverse language acquisition for young children. The effectiveness of the usage of music as a tool for foreign language
								learning is also highly depended on the educators’ approach and guidance in the lesson program (Kultti, 2013).
								Moreover, the frequency of the foreign language lesson is also impacted on the learning outcomes of the children as
								the research discovered that the shorter and frequent lesson has better results compared to the longer lesson with less
								frequent ones (Graham, Courtney, Marinis &amp; Tonkyn, 2017). It is may because the shorter duration makes the lesson
								more interesting to the children as children sometimes can be easy to get bored with the longer duration activity. The
								frequency makes children encounter that certain language structure more frequent which results in better learning
								outcomes in foreign language learning. The variety of the activities also important as same activity such as singing a
								same song everyday could make children not feeling interested.</p>
								<h3>Supportive environment of the classroom</h3>
								<p>Classroom environment also one of the most important factors in successful language learning program, where
								educators also need to create a positive and supportive environment for children to learn. The educators’ preparation
								in the planning program activity has to be aligned to the children’s interests and abilities as the starting points of
								the musical activities which could promote a foreign language acquisition (Kultti, 2013). Besides, children who have
								experienced two or more different cultural systems can benefit through the support of adults’ practices in everyday
								activities. Another important thing to be considered by educators is the song tempo/rate, where slower rate of song
								allows children to have more time to catch the words better compare to the normal speech (Good et al., 2014).
								Therefore, the musical activity has to be appropriate to the children’s age group, interests, and previous learning to
								be able to success in foreign language learning.</p>
